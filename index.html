        <h1>Magma Overpressure Estimation from Partially Exposed Dykes</h1>
        <h2>Biswas et al. (2023 & 2025)</h2>
        <p>Knowledge of complete dyke dimensions is crucial to determine the actual aspect ratio which is indispensable
            in estimating their magma overpressure, depth of origin and even explosivity potential of fissure eruptions.
            A dearth of completely exposed dykes imposes considerable uncertainty on estimates of their aspect ratios.
            Therefore, we introduce mathematical methods of estimating complete dyke dimensions from their partial
            exposures consisting of at least one visible tip or devoid of any tip. The methods are built upon the idealized
            canonical model of opening mode fractures and utilize the elliptical shape of opening of dykes in 2D as
            formulated in the model. Subsequently, the calculated aspect ratio is used to estimate magma overpressure for a dyke following <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/0191-8141(83)90075-5" target="_blank"
                style="font-size:1.0vw">Gudmundsson, 1983</a>.
            Although developed for dykes, the methods have potential for wider application,
            since they can be used fundamentally to predict complete dimensions of any elliptical shaped natural
            features from their partial exposures.</p>
        <h2>1. Partial dyke exposure with one visible tip</h2>
        <p>This method (Biswas et al., 2023) solves the equation of ellipse which is the predicted shape of dyke opening
            in the canonical model using every possible combination of two points lying on the dyke margin measured from
            the observed tip to estimate the full length, maximum width and aspect ratio.

        <h2>2. Partial dyke exposure with no visible tip</h2>
        <p>This method (Biswas et al., 2025) utilizes discrete derivatives derived from limited outcrop measurements made
            on dyke margins in the differential equations of ellipse, which is the predicted shape of fracture opening
            in the canonical model, to estimate the full length, maximum width and aspect ratio.</p>
